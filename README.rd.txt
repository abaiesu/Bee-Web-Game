Bee is a game where the player controls a bee and can shoot projectiles in order to kill spiders. The goal is to kill the most spiders as possible. A counter keeps track of the number of spiders killed.
The player starts a game by clicking on “START”. He can also have a look at the rules of the game by clicking on “How to play”. Clicking on START starts all the animations. 
Once the game is started, spiders start to appear. The bee and the spider designs are made by hand and animated with JavaScript. The bee follows the moves of the mouse and the projectiles and the spiders have straight horizontal trajectories. The projectiles appear wherever the player clicks, and spiders appear randomly from the right side of the screen.
The background is a gradient obtained with CSS and the flowers are fixed elements used as decoration.
The difficulty of the game increases with time. As levels go up, the spiders gain more speed and appear more and more frequently. 
Shooting projectiles, killing spiders and being touched by a spider are all associated with different sound effects. 
If a spider touches the bee, all animations stop and the player can restart the game by clicking on “TRY AGAIN”. The number of killed bees and the levels are then reinitialized.
